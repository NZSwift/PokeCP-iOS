## Introduction
* PokeCP is an iOS Application build by Swift, and it's open-source. The propose of this APP is for player to calculate the combat power value, and see which pokemon would be after evolution.

## Make it better
* Current stage only has two features:
	* Combat power calculation.
	* Username checking.
	
* Other feature such as radar detection may consider develop. If you have idea or solution could achieved, feel free to open an issue and I will see what I can do for that.

## What does it look like
